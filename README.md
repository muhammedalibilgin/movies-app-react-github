# movies-app-react-github

I created this site while following Gürcan Çekiç Reactjs course.In this course, not just about react but also rest api usage is explained.(we used themoviedb API).This course alone is not enough to master React but it's pretty self explanatory to understand and get a basics on React.Knowledge gained in this course;

* What is react and what does it do?
* What are components, jsx, props and what do they do?
* Controlled component, state update with setstate.
* React router
* API, Rest Api, HTTP requests, json server
